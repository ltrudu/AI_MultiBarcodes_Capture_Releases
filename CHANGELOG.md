# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI MultiBarcode Capture Application are documented in this file.

### Version 1.36 - ⚡ **Performance & Android 15+ Compatibility**

**Ultra-fast native grayscale image processing with NDK/JNI and Android 15+ 16KB page size support.**

#### ⚡ **Native NDK Grayscale Optimization:**

• **Ultra-Fast Y-Plane Extraction**: Native C++ implementation extracts grayscale directly from YUV Y-plane
  - **No Color Conversion Required**: Y-plane IS grayscale - just copy it directly (no YUV→RGB math needed)
  - **Single Plane Processing**: Only reads Y-plane, completely skips U/V planes
  - **Direct Bitmap Writing**: Native code writes directly to Android Bitmap using `AndroidBitmap_lockPixels()` for zero-copy operation
  - **Automatic Fallback**: Graceful Java implementation fallback when native library is unavailable

• **Performance Comparison** (Old RGB vs New Grayscale):

  | Metric | YUV→RGB | Y→Grayscale | Improvement |
  |--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
  | Planes processed | 3 (Y,U,V) | 1 (Y only) | 3x less data |
  | Operations/pixel | ~15 | ~3 | 5x fewer ops |
  | Color math | Yes (BT.601) | None | No computation |
  | Memory reads | 3 buffers | 1 buffer | 3x less I/O |

#### 📱 **Android 15+ 16KB Page Size Support:**

• **Future-Proof Compatibility**: Native library built with 16KB page size alignment for Android 15+ devices
  - **`-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384`**: Linker flag ensures compatibility with devices using 16KB memory pages
  - **Seamless Operation**: Works transparently on both traditional 4KB and new 16KB page size devices
  - **No Runtime Configuration Required**: Compatibility is built into the native library at compile time

#### 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

• **Native Library (`libyuvprocessor.so`)**:
  - `cropYToGrayscaleBitmapNative()`: Ultra-fast Y-plane to grayscale Bitmap (primary method)
  - `cropYuvToBitmapNative()`: Full YUV420 to RGB Bitmap conversion (available if needed)
  - ARM NEON SIMD optimization on 32-bit devices (`-mfpu=neon` for armeabi-v7a)
  - Aggressive compiler optimizations: `-O3 -ffast-math` for maximum performance

• **Build Configuration**:
  - CMake-based native build fully integrated with Gradle build system
  - Multi-ABI support: arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64
  - Automatic native library bundling in APK

• **Java Integration**:
  - `NativeYuvProcessor.java`: JNI wrapper class with static library loading
  - `cropYuvToGrayscaleNative()`: Primary method using Y-plane extraction
  - `cropYuvToGrayscaleJava()`: Java fallback for devices without native support
  - `isAvailable()`: Runtime check for native library availability

#### 💡 **Benefits:**

• **Maximum Performance**: Grayscale Y-plane extraction is the fastest possible approach for capture zone cropping

• **Real-time Configuration Updates**: Settings changes automatically restart CameraXLivePreviewActivity and reload BarcodeTracker configuration without full app restart  
• **Performance-Aware UI**: Smart descriptions guide users to optimal settings based on scanning requirements (large/close barcodes vs small/distant barcodes)  
• **Constants-Based Architecture**: All hardcoded settings moved to Constants class with consistent preference key naming patterns  
• **Automatic Translation System**: Enhanced translation workflow with comprehensive verification and 72 language support including high-quality translations for major languages  

### Technical Enhancements:
• Removed hardcoded `InferencerOptions.DSP` and `640x640` dimensions from BarcodeTracker  
• Dynamic shared preferences loading with enum-based configuration (EInferenceType.toInferencerOptions(), EModelInputSize.getWidth/getHeight(), ECameraResolution.getWidth/getHeight())  
• ManagedConfigurationReceiver enhanced with nested bundle support and activity restart mechanism  
• Universal translation script with intelligent Android project detection and detailed completion reporting

The advanced configuration system provides granular control over AI performance and camera capabilities, enabling optimal barcode detection for different use cases while supporting enterprise deployment scenarios through comprehensive managed configuration integration.

## Version 1.20
**Comprehensive language selection system with 71+ language support**

Add complete internationalization capabilities with comprehensive language selection and localization:

• Language selection dropdown in settings with native language names and Unicode flag emojis (🇫🇷 Français, 🇪🇸 Español, 🇩🇪 Deutsch, etc.)
• Support for 71+ languages including System Language option with automatic detection  
• Validation-based language switching - changes apply only when settings are confirmed, not immediately  
• Complete string externalization with translations for all supported languages  
• Persistent language preference storage that survives app restarts and device reboots  
• Full application restart mechanism ensuring proper locale switching across all activities  
• Custom dropdown styling with white background and zebra blue outline matching app theme
• Improved settings UI with button reordering (Cancel left, Validate right)
• Comprehensive locale management through LocaleHelper utility with flag emoji mapping
• Enhanced user experience with language changes requiring explicit validation

The language system provides enterprise-grade internationalization support, allowing users to override system language preferences while maintaining consistent UI theming and providing immediate visual feedback through country flag emojis.

## Version 1.18
**Persistent flashlight toggle with automatic state restoration**

Enhance camera functionality with persistent flashlight control that remembers user preferences across app sessions:

• Flashlight toggle icon automatically restores previous on/off state when opening camera view  
• Flashlight setting persists through app restarts, activity navigation, and device orientation changes    
• Improved user experience with consistent lighting preferences across barcode capture workflows  

Users can now toggle the flashlight on during scanning and expect it to remain active when returning to the camera view, providing continuous lighting support for challenging scanning environments without needing to manually re-enable the flashlight each time.

## Version 1.17
**Implement interactive capture zone with barcode filtering**

Add a complete capture zone system that allows users to define a rectangular area for focused barcode scanning:

• Interactive capture zone overlay with drag, resize, and corner anchor controls  
• Visual toggle icon in top-right corner with enabled/disabled states using alpha transparency  
• Real-time barcode filtering - only process barcodes within the capture zone boundaries  
• Persistent settings that save zone position, size, and enabled state across app sessions  
• Comprehensive capture data filtering - only capture barcodes within the defined zone  
• Force portrait mode across entire application for consistent user experience  
• Enhanced logging and error handling for capture zone operations  

The capture zone provides users with precise control over barcode detection, allowing them to focus on specific areas of the camera view while ignoring barcodes outside the defined region. When enabled, both the real-time preview and final capture results only include barcodes that intersect with the capture zone.
